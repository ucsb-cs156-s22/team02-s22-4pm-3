Set up a team deployments for prod and qa on Heroku

# Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] The main branch is deployed on Heroku at, for example,
      <https://s22-5pm-1-team02.herokuapp.com> (substituting your
      own team name for `s22-5pm-1`), and is set up for automatic
      deployment.  
- [ ] All members of the team are added to the Heroku deployment.
- [ ] The course instructor (`phtcon@ucsb.edu`) and the mentor listed
      at <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/s22/info/teams/> is added to
      the heroku  deployment. (Ask for the email they use with
      Heroku via Slack.)
- [ ] Repeat the above steps for your team's QA deployment, which follows the same naming convention as the production app except with `-qa` appended to it. For example, <https://s22-5pm-1-team02-qa.herokuapp.com>.
- [ ] Links to both your team's production and QA Heroku deployments are added to the top of your team's `README.md` file, replacing the `TODO` entry.
